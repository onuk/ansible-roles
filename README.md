My Ansible roles
=========

Every day I use a bunch of Ansible roles to manage different infrastructures. I like to use reusable roles as possible, and in this place, I maintain them for myself. Feel free to use them, fork them, or take inspiration from them!

The roles are made for Ubuntu.

- The roles are not on Ansible Galaxy. You can install them [from GitHub](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#installing-a-collection-from-a-git-repository) directly.

Roles

- [ansible-pritunl](https://github.com/onuk/ansible-pritunl) - This ansible role installs the [Pritunl VPN](https://pritunl.com) server.
